The first time I tried to write Python with emacs, I've found there're really
really too many choices, which may make newbies confusing and disgusting.

Say =python-mode=, before [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/news/NEWS.24.3][Emacs 24.3]], there're at least three choices:
- The old =python.el= from Emacs, which has some minor problems when dealing
  with docstring, Python 3k, etc.
- The =python-mode.el= from the Python community, which provides lots of dirty
  menu items. It's a tedious long journey to make all this menu items just
  work.
- The wonderful =python.el= from [[https://github.com/fgallina/python.el][fgallina]], which overcomes many drawbacks of
  the old Emacs builtin =python.el=, and has been [[http://from-the-cloud.com/en/emacs/2012/06/18_pythonel-has-landed-on-emacs-trunk.html][integrated to Emacs trunk]]. I
  think this is the best choice of the three.

Say code checking tools,
- What is [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8][pep8]]?
- What is [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylint][pylint]]?
- What is [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes/][pyflakes]]?
- What is [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8][flake8]]?
- What's the differences between all these fucking wonderful code checking
  tools? How and when should I use it? Which one to use? Any shortcuts to fire
  these tools within =python-mode=?

Say developing tools,
- What is [[http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/][virtualenv]]?
- What about code completion? Maybe after two days' google, you finally make
  [[http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/][auto-complete]] works with a completion backend, such as [[http://rope.sourceforge.net/][rope]] or [[https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi][jedi]], but how
  can you make completion be virtualenv-awared?

Choices, choices, choices, choices are where all happiness and headaches
begins. Just google a minute you'll find articles which use different
=python-mode=, different dotemacs, different way to get necessary packages,
are, what's the fuck[1]! I'm just a newbie, any out-of-box solutions?
Fortunately, there comes [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy][elpy]], which saves our lifes.

Just like other big emacs packages, elpy has some external dependencies. But
don't be afraid, believe me, within minutes, you'll get an out-of-box Emacs
Python "IDE". First, make sure you have =python= and =pip= installed, and then
type =pip install elpy= with root priviledge[2], then choose a completion
backend, either =pip install rope= or =pip install jedi= [3].

Make sure you have others necessary python tools installed:
- =pip install virtualenv=
- =pip install pyflakes=
- =pip install nose=

If you're lucky enough, you can fire up Emacs and start python work right now.

There're other annoying problems, one of them is the division between Python 2
and Python 3. So you may need to replace =pip= with =pip2=, or =python= with
=python2=, etc. Ah, different systems has different favors and naming rules.

The second thing is, elpy requires Emacs version >= 24.3, since Emacs 24.3
ships with a new =python.el= [4], which, actually, is the aforementioned
[[https://github.com/fgallina/python.el][fgallina]]'s =python.el=. So you may need to upgrade your builin =python.el=, but
don't worry, oh-my-emacs will handle this for you!

Third, current elpy use [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/flymake/index.html][flymake]] as its syntax checker, while oh-my-emacs favors
[[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][flycheck]]. Seems elpy has a [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy/issues/137][plan]] to support both flycheck and flymake.

There's also a [[https://github.com/gabrielelanaro/emacs-for-python][emacs-for-python]] project in github, which attracts more github
stars than elpy, but I don't like its approach, since it will clean out all
your existing dotemacs and replace with a wholly new, which is just useful for
Python. However, elpy is just a plugin, though it implements lots of features
with the help from other packages, you can still disable or enable elpy,
without breaking your existing precious dotemacs.

Thanks [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy][elpy]] again, for time it saves for us, through which we can focus more
on Python, on our life, instead of the details to make choices. Elpy is the
ultimate out-of-box Emacs Python "IDE" solution.

By default, =(elpy-enable)= will [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy/blob/master/elpy.el#L343][modify]] auto-complete's keymap, which would
make auto-complete unoperative when you try to complete function arguments with
[[https://github.com/brianjcj/auto-complete-clang/blob/master/screenshot/clang-3.png][auto-complete-clang]] by utilize =yas-expand= from YASnippet. I've spent a whole
day to trace this problem and finally find here. So I use =(elpy-enable t)=
instead. Please =C-h f elpy-enable RET= to get details.

From version 1.3, elpy replaced [[https://github.com/aculich/virtualenv.el][virtualenv.el]] with [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/pyvenv][pyvenv]], see [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy/issues/149][here]] for
details.

Also, elpy integrates with [[http://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/][nosetests]], =C-c C-t= will run nose on your
project. So you should =pip install nose= if you want to use nosetests with
elpy.

Some python web frameworks often provide a =*.wsgi= file to application
initialization, which is just a plain python file.

* Todo
- Add some django-mode support? Maybe
  https://github.com/fgallina/python-django.el is a good candidate.
- Auto-complete support for completion in =inferior-python-mode= like
  SLIME. Maybe the general auto-complete readline backend
  https://github.com/monsanto/readline-complete.el is the ultimate solution
  for REPL languages.
